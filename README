To run the app clone the repo or download the files and run "npm i" which will install all the required dependencies.

The app will work best in POSTMAM for testing the API.

Assumptions made: 
1. The user can make the payment and from the date of payment the user will have validity of 1 month.

Edge Case Handeled: If user has an existing validity then the new payment made will add 1 month to the previous validity and extend it
Otherwise the validity will be 1 month from today i.e. the date of payment.

2. The User can register with basic details and will get an confirmation upon doing the same.

3. Also the user can view the batch history and the past payments made from the api. However I felt short at hooking this particular page in the frontend but its working perfectly fine when tested through POSTMAN.

4. If in case the user wants to change his/her batch then they can do it at the time of making the payment and specifying then and there only in which batch do they wanna join.
